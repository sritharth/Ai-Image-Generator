# vision-prompt

VisionPrompt is a lightweight, responsive web application that transforms your words into visuals using the Pollinations AI image generation API. With a simple user interface built in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, VisionPrompt offers real-time image creation directly from the browser based on user-submitted text prompts.

Frontend Implementation (HTML/CSS/JS):
The interface of VisionPrompt is designed using clean HTML5, responsive CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. The layout ensures compatibility across screen sizes and delivers an intuitive user experience. JavaScript dynamically handles input capture, API communication, and image rendering on the UI.

Image Generation via Pollinations API:
VisionPrompt uses a dynamic API URL to interact with the Pollinations AI endpoint. When a user enters a prompt, it is encoded and passed through the API URL, which generates an image based on the described content. The response is handled using JavaScriptâ€™s fetch() and displayed in real time without page reloads.
